## Definition: 
Loss is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. Lower loss indicates a better model. Types: Common types include: Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used in regression tasks (predicting continuous values). Cross-Entropy Loss: Used in classification tasks (predicting discrete categories). 
## Goal: 
The aim is to minimize the loss over time as the model learns from the data.
